Hello Parents!

I've created a FREE parental control software called *GameBlocker* that I wanted to share with you all.

*What does it do?*
- Blocks gaming apps (Steam, Epic Games, Roblox, Minecraft, etc.)
- Blocks AI services (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) so kids do their own homework
- Blocks gaming and AI websites
- Works even when you're not around!

*Key Features:*
- Schedule-based blocking (block during school hours, bedtime, etc.)
- Password protected - kids can't disable it
- Runs silently in the background
- Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

*Example Schedules:*
- School Hours: Block Mon-Fri 8AM-3PM
- Bedtime: Block 9PM-7AM every day
- Weekend Gaming: Allow Sat-Sun 2PM-6PM only

*How to get it:*
Contact me and I'll send you the installer for your computer (Windows/Mac/Linux).

*Setup is easy:*
1. Install the app
2. Create a parent password
3. Choose what to block
4. Set your schedules
5. Done! It runs automatically

Let me know if you have any questions or need help setting it up!
